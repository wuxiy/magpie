// an absent command, a copy at or ahead of the app, and a copy that isn't a
// release (a source build, or one that won't run): none of those is a stale
// release to nag about. The bin dir is pointed at a temp dir through
// MAGPIE_BIN_DIR, the one install.sh honors, so the test needs no real
// $HOME; only the Mac has the two-places problem, so it skips elsewhere.
