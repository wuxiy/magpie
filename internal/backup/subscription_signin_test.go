package backup

// What a backup must never carry: a subscription's sign-in. #880 asked for
// one and was closed as intentional — a subscription is the sign-in of an
// agent on one machine, so each machine signs in on its own, and a bundle
// that carried one would sign the agent in on the machine it was put on.
//
// The policy has two sides. A subscription the user has moved onto its
// plugin still has a row in providers.json, and that row travels, so the
// receiving machine offers the subscription. What stays behind is the
// credential behind the row: the row travels, the credential does not.
//
// Both sides are pinned here, on the built-in store (logins.json) and the
// plugin store (plugin-auth.json), under both credential policies of
// Collect, with a typed key as the control: a user-typed key syncs, so the
// policy is not "nothing credential-shaped syncs".
