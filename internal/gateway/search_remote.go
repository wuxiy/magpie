// itself, else with its own searcher. Its list says which of the two for
// each model (web_search: "native" or "magpie"), and a web search offered
// to one of them goes to it as it was offered rather than being run here
// with this magpie's searcher (Player on Discord: remoteMagpie/glm-5.3's
// searches went to another model). Only a model it searches by itself,
// natively, is one this magpie may search with for its other models: a
// search magpie runs for another model is marked (SearchingHeader), and
// the other magpie runs no searcher of its own for it, so two magpies
