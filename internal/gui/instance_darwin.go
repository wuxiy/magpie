// its own open at login (a LaunchAgent that runs the binary) and by a
// Login Item the user added, or by the Mac reopening it after a shutdown
// it wasn't quit for (Crispin on Discord: two magpies after each boot).
// A start at login just ends; one for the window has the running magpie
// show its window (the Dock's reopen), and a magpie:// link is opened,
// which the Mac hands to the running one.
